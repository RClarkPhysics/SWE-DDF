This test was done on a SWE fluid with:
epsilon=1e-8
f0=1e-5
beta=1e-12
A=1e2
Forcing2=1e-5
dt=1e-1

Taking the first 3 by 3 square (1,1) though (3,3) from what was originally a 10 by 10 grid, we conduct a reduced dimension DDF Forecast. This test was conducted with Time delay embedding. There were 20 Time Delay sets and each set had 27 dimensions. The time delay was 17 time steps. Each time step was 0.1 hours. The DDF RBF was Gaussian + 1st order polynomials of the LEADING 27 dimensions (I exclude the delayed dimensions). The inclusion of polynomials dramatically improves the forecast over pure gaussian RBFs from my findings. The inclusion of more time delays was also found to improve the forecast, which is why I have a whopping 20 time delay sets.

This SWE has Coriolis, drag, friction, and the Forcing in the x-direction. The training was done on the firs 10k data points and 5k were forecasted afterwards with much success. This is not a chaotic system, but is very nonlinear and as such we are able to forecast it for a great length of time.
